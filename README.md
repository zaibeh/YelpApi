Homework 5 was the development of the Yelp application. It utilizes the Yelp API - in 
which we are able to extract data from to place inside the RecyclerView. The
MainActivity is responsible for compiling the data from the RestaurantAdapter, 
YelpData, and YelpInterface activities and placing them into the RecyclerView format.
The user is able to type their preferred food and location, which will be collected
as data for the Yelp API for display.
